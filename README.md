## 📝 About
This script was my first attempt at automating fuel price checks.  
It fetches data from online sources, performs a simple analysis, and outputs which fuel station is the cheapest within a certain radius.  

After using the script for a while, I realized that creating an **Android app** would make it much more user-friendly. That app is now my daily tool for tracking fuel prices.
